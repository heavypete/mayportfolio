# Test 2 - UI Basics - MOCK

## Test Info

- In this project there is an index.html file, a style.css file and a folder "images" with images. In the files there are already the basics for a website for a flower store.
- Your task is to follow the instructions below to improve the website.
- Good luck!

  \*Note: Look at the website first before you start with the tasks.

## Test Instructions:

### Preview

The top page should look like this:

![preview](./images/mock_uib_final_assessment_mockup.png)

### Images

<!--
- Use the image [hero.jpg](./images/hero.jpg) as background image in the header. The image should take up the whole width of the header, it should not be repeated and it should be centered. -->

### Position

<!-- - Change the position of the header to fixed. The header should be at the top of the page and not cover any other content on the page. -->

### Attributes

- Add a `fontawesome` icon to all links that have the `target="_blank"` attribute. You should use the attribute to select the elements and add the icon directly in the css file. You should use the pseudo-element `::after` on the attribute selector for this. The font (font-family) should be "FontAwesome" and the content should be `" \f35d"`.

### Responsive Design

<!-- - Use Flex-box to make the layout of the cards in the "Product Card" section responsive. The cards should appear in a column on mobile and in a row on tablet/desktop (breakpoint: `768px`). The column and row should be centered on the page. The row should not stretch over several lines, i.e. should not have a break.

- The heading in the header should have a padding of `7rem` on the right on displays larger than `768px`. -->

### Tables

<!-- - Add a table with the following structure under the `<h2>` tag in the "Product Information" section:

- A gray frame around the table, the table headers and the table rows. The frames should overlap each other (collapse) if necessary. Each odd row should be white and each even row should be gray. The table should occupy '100%' of the width.

#### Structure for the table

| ------        | roses | sunflowers | tulips |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| **Bremen**    | 823   | 432        | 231    |
| **Berlin**    | 351   | 420        | 559    |
| **Hamburg**   | 94    | 34         | 71     |
| **Stuttgart** | 34    | 39         | 62     | -->

### Forms (Forms)

- In the "Contact Form" section, create a form with:

  - an input field for the username
  - an input field for the e-mail address
  - a text field (textarea) for a message
  - a button

  The form should be placed under the `h2` element.

  The button should have the class `submit-btn`.

  Also create `label` elements for each input field and for the textarea, e.g. "Tell us who you are", "Tell us how to contact you", "How can we help you?".

- Add types and placeholder text for the input fields and the text field.

  - The first input field should have the type `text` and the placeholder text: "Please fill in your full name". It should also have a minimum length of 1.

  - The second input field should be of type `email` and have the placeholder text: "Please enter your email". It should also have a minimum length of 5.
  - The text field should have the following placeholder text: "Send us a message!" and a minimum length of 1.

- For Focus, change the outline color of the input fields and the text field to blue.

### Links in the Footer

<!--
- In the "Footer links" section, add an unordered list under the `h3` element. The list should have the class `icon-list`.

* Add 3 items to the list. Each item should have the class `icon`.

* Each item should have a link embedded in it. Add only one "#" symbol in the attribute `href`.

* Find three social media icons to embed in the links (i.e. the icons are the links), e.g. to Instagram, Linked in and Twitter.
